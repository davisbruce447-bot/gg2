      REMOVED: The <script type="importmap"> was here.
      It is not needed for a standard Vite build process, as Vite bundles all dependencies
      (like React and Supabase) from your package.json into the final JavaScript file.
      Leaving it in can cause conflicts with the production build.

      IMPORTANT FOR DEPLOYMENT:
      This HTML file is for development. To deploy this app to a static host like InfinityFree,
      you MUST build it first. Run the following commands in your project folder:
      1. npm install
      2. npm run build
      Then, upload the CONTENTS of the 'dist' folder (NOT the folder itself) to your server's
      root directory (e.g., 'htdocs'). The build process will create a new, optimized index.html
      in the 'dist' folder with the correct script tags for the compiled JavaScript.
      The blank page on your live site is because servers cannot run ".tsx" files directly.
